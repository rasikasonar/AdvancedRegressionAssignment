# Advanced Regression Assignment - House price prediction
> The aim of this project is to build a regression model using ridge and lasso regularisation technique. 
The model reads a set of historical data about the houses that were sold in the past.
By analysing the variables (columns) present in the dataset, the model builds a linear regression 
Model which predicts the variables that are effective in predicting the price of a house.

## General Information
- Build a linear regression model using regularisation techniques (ridge and lasso)
- The model should find out what all variables are effective in prodicting the price of a house
- The model built using multiple linear regression model may be overfitting. The aim is to address this problem by using regularisation techniques
- The dataset that is considered is train.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The model built using ridge and lasso regularisation technique is able to explain around 82% of variance in the dataset
